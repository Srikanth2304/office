I have been working on a data monitoring tool called Grafana, where we utilize logs from Elastic as the data source. Last month, I focused on enhancing the functionality by adding logs to the source code in the TransactionServiceHostBean.java file. This involved printing channel ID, transaction type, external system key, and total time taken in Elastic, with the goal of creating a failure rate dashboard in Grafana.
