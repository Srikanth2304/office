I sincerely apologize if it seemed like I was not responding. Over the past few days, I have been actively following up with my current manager and the assigned team lead regarding the timesheet access. However, they mentioned that some internal alignment was needed before I could proceed, and I was awaiting their confirmation.

I want to take a moment to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work with the Core Banking team. It has truly been a valuable experience — I’ve gained significant knowledge in both development and application areas, which I will always carry forward in my career.

I’ve been following up with my current manager and team lead regarding timesheet access, but they needed to align with others before proceeding. I’m still waiting for their confirmation and will update it as soon as access is given.

Also, thank you for the opportunity to work with the Core Banking team — I’ve learned a lot in terms of development and application knowledge.
