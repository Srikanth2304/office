eOps Step Rules and route types
Overview
eOps Flexi/Steps are static content screens with custom data entry fields with out any validations applied to it. To make it render dynamically, we have to apply rules/validations on it.
We can apply/call our custom rules/validations/Business operations in below ways.
➢ On Load of a Step
➢ On Complete of a Step
➢ On enter of a field value after opening a transaction in particular step.
Configuration Details
Table: STEPRULEMAPPING
Column: RULEID
More than one ruleid can be mapped to same step name and processed.
TRIGGEREVENT in STEPRULEMAPPING can have below valid values.
➢ LOAD/(null) – will be called on load of a step
➢ COMP - will be called on complete of a step
➢ CKLT - on click of checklist widget
➢ SAVE - on click of save button
➢ RESP -
➢ REST -
➢ ACOM -
➢ AUTO - will be called when the transaction landed into particular
manual step
INTERNAL
Each ruleid will have reference in below tables. Ruleid in steprulemapping is same as Functionid in Function table.
➢ FUNCTION
➢ FUNCTIONOPERATIONS
➢ OPERATIONS
Serial / Conditional / Parallel Function Operations
INTERNAL
Overview
A group of operations can be triggered for a Step in different ways as given below.
➢ Serial
➢ Conditional and
➢ Parallel
Configuration Details
Table: FUNCTION
Column: ROUTETYPE
Route type column can have below possible values.
➢ SERIAL
➢ CONDITIONAL
➢ PARALLEL
If it is SERIAL, list of operations configured in Functionoperations table for the corresponding Functionid will be executed in a sequential order based on the sequence number.
If it is CONDITIONAL, an additional RULEID should be configured in FUNCTION table as given below. This RULEID will refer the RULEDEFINITION table to get the ROUTEID (Ex: R0,R1) and the operations corresponding to that route id from FUNCTIONOPERATIONS table alone will be executed.
INTERNAL
If it is PARALLEL, list of operations to be executed will be configured in camel xml file based on the configuration in camel file.
Camel configurations
Overview
Business validations can be done in xml document using camel framework.
Configuration Details
Table: FUNCTION
Column: ROUTETYPE
ROUTETYPE should be configured as PARALLEL
In <<Processid>>_camel.xml file for each parallel processed, corresponding list of operations to be executed based on conditions can be configured.
Sample Camel.xml file:
