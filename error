### **Application Health Check Implementation - Discussion & Plan**  

#### **1. Requirements for Implementation in COP**  
To ensure proper monitoring and health checks for the application, the following requirements must be met:  
- **JBoss and Database Availability:** Verify whether JBoss and the database are running.  
- **Cluster Health Check:** Ensure the application is functioning correctly within the cluster.  

---

#### **2. Discussion Points**  

##### **2.1 Health Check Implementation**  
- A **`HealthCheck.jsp`** file will be created to return a status code for checking the application's health.  
- If the status code is **`0000`**, the application is healthy.  
- If the response code deviates from `0000`, further investigation is required.  
- Currently, the four zeros (`0000`) indicate the health of **JBoss and the database**, with plans to extend it to include two additional components in the future.  

##### **2.2 Log Monitoring & Extraction**  
- The response code will be extracted using **regular expressions (regex)** from logs.  
- Log extraction will consider **application names** or **server details** to determine if four zeros (`0000`) appear consistently.  

##### **2.3 YAML File for Configuration**  
- YAML files will be created to configure the process of retrieving the health check response code.  
- The YAML file will dictate whether the extracted response code should be displayed or flagged for further investigation.  

---

#### **3. Alternative Approach**  

##### **3.1 Network Access Request for COP**  
- Since the **COP team** does not have direct access to the servers, they will raise a request to **increase the CIDR range** to allow access to the applicationâ€™s security group.  

##### **3.2 Health Check Metrics & Dashboard**  
- The **COPS team** is responsible for managing health check metrics.  
- Once they set up a **dashboard**, further **optimizations** can be made based on our specific monitoring requirements.  

---

### **Next Steps**  
1. **Develop `HealthCheck.jsp`** to return health status codes.  
2. **Implement regex-based log extraction** to analyze health status from logs.  
3. **Configure YAML files** for monitoring application health.  
4. **Raise CIDR range request** for access (if required).  
5. **Work with the COPS team** to optimize dashboard metrics.
