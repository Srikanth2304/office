1. Objective:
The objective is to deploy a Logstash configuration file to convert logs into JSON format for Grafana visualization.

2. Scope of Changes:
**List of files that were changed:**
- **14147-rcb-atlas-cloud-elk** â†’ **logstash.conf**

3. Process Overview:

**3.1 Pull Request (PR) Submission:**
- After adding the new Logstash file into the feature branch, raise a request for approval to merge the source code into the main branch.

**3.2 Approval Workflow:**
- Create a work item and include the PR in it.
- Add details of the merging branch and a description explaining the effect of these changes.
- Share the work item with the respective approver to obtain approval and proceed with merging the PR.
- After the code is merged, check the pipeline and execute it as shown in the referenced images.

**3.3 Post-Merge Updates:**
- After the pipeline runs successfully, verify the latest build.
- Navigate to **14147-sc-aws-atlas-uae-tf12-hk** and update the Logstash file name in **elk-logstash.sh** as follows:
  - Update the build link in the yellow highlighted line.
  - Update the build number in the green highlighted line.
  - Update the Logstash file name in the orange highlighted area.
- Commit the changes into the feature branch and raise a PR to **hotfix/ecr/AE_ELK_DEPLOY**.
- Access the pipeline and search for the repository name as shown in the referenced image.
- Run the pipeline by changing the branch name from **main** to **hotfix/ecr/AE_ELK_DEPLOY**.

**3.4 Deployment Process:**
- Execute the pipeline up to the **dev** environment. Approval is required to run the pipeline at **dev**.
- Obtain permission from the respective approver to proceed.
- The Logstash file gets deployed successfully after following these steps.

4. Impact Assessment:
- The process is used for deploying the Logstash file.
- Logstash files convert logs into JSON format, enabling Grafana to pick variable values from the JSON logs.

5. Next Steps:
- Verify whether the values are reflecting correctly in Grafana dashboards.

6. References:
- Reference for writing a Logstash file.
- Git commands and process references for committing the code.

7. Conclusion:
This structured format ensures all essential aspects of the changes and workflow are documented clearly.
