3.Process Overview:

3.1 Pull Request (PR) Submission


After commiting the changes into the feature branch , raise a approval to merge the source code into respective develop branch


3.2 Approval Workflow
Raise a work item with the PR including in it
add merging branch details and description describing effect of these changes  

share the work item to respective person for getting approval and merging the PR
After the code got merged , look for the latest build and check  the changes are reflecting in class file or not
For knowing the process of checking the changes in respective class file follow this link :





If changes are found , create a deployment request for deploying the latest source changes



Get approval from the RM team and share the deployment PR to respective person

4. Impact Assessment:
We used this process for adding logs and changes into respective files 
Converting logs into json format
the variables added in the logs are used in grafana monitoring tool ,for picking the values and showing them in dashboards
5.Next Steps:
Grafana picks the values in logs , if those are in json format.
For AE the logs cant be converted into json directly , so we are using logstash file for converting them into json format
6.References:
reference for how to write a logstash file :
reference for how deploy the logstash file :




This structured format ensures all essential aspects of the changes and workflow are documented clearly.
